Shrek math software is designed for ease of use, and is a powerful device for the modification of waveforms.

> Creating tabs

To create a tab containing a function, press the plus button in the second tab column, and select what you would like to name your tab, and what you would like it to do. After, press create.
 
 The first tab column is for importing external files (.wav only)
 
 > Using tabs
  
Inside each tab, select the desired tab function (e.g, if you selected a trigonometry tab, you option would be trigonometry functions)

Set the tab's input using the tab input button, and select the tab to set an input from by clicking it. In some tabs there will be two inputs, which function in the same way.

Tabs may be deleted by pressing the 'delete' button, which will delete the tab you are in.

> Saving projects

In order to save a project, go to settings, and press 'save as new'. The file will be saved with the .shrek filename extension. 

> Opening projects

To open a file, press 'Open', and select the project to open _note: .shrek files cannot be opened in any program other than shrek math_
